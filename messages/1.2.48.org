	- I found myself adding a Created property to a lot of new notes.
	  (I like timestamps on when a note has been created)
	  So I have added a new command Org Insert Created Property that will
	  auto insert a :Created: [TIMESTAMP] to a heading, saves me a few keystrokes.
	  (See above for the format)


** FIXED FILETAGS
   Filestags with colons around them were not having the colon stripped.
   This was a bug introduced a while back and I did not notice.
   This is no longer the case:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
      #+FILETAGS: :A:B:C:
   #+END_SRC 

   Will now correctly tag all nodes with A B and C tags
