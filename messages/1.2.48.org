	- I found myself adding a Created property to a lot of new notes.
	  (I like timestamps on when a note has been created)
	  So I have added a new command Org Insert Created Property that will
	  auto insert a :Created: [TIMESTAMP] to a heading, saves me a few keystrokes.
	  (See above for the format)
