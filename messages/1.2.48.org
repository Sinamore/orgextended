	- I found myself adding a Created property to a lot of new notes.
	  (I like timestamps on when a note has been created)
	  So I have added a new command Org Insert Created Property that will
	  auto insert a :Created: [TIMESTAMP] to a heading, saves me a few keystrokes.
	  (See above for the format)


** FIXED FILETAGS
   Filestags with colons around them were not having the colon stripped.
   This was a bug introduced a while back and I did not notice.
   This is no longer the case:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
      #+FILETAGS: :A:B:C:
   #+END_SRC 

   Will now correctly tag all nodes with A B and C tags

** FIXED Checkbox summaries
   Summaries that were followed by a list of checkboxes in a second heading could miscalculate the summary
   including checkboxes from the next heading

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
      
   * A [1/2]       <-- This would be miscalculated as [1/3] vs [1/2]
     - [ ] B
     - [x] C
   ** D 
     - [ ] E

   While still facilitating nested summaries:

   * Heading [3/5]
   - [x] A
   - [x] B
   - [ ] C
   - [-] D [1/3]
      - [ ] X
      - [x] Y
      - [ ] Z
   - [x] E

   #+END_SRC
   
** FIXED Clocking in and out was crashing
   Clocking in and out on a node was throwing exceptions due to the property
   drawer API attempting to operate on a root node. This should now be fixed.

** New Command Org Jump To Clock
   This will jump to an active clock if one is running.

** New Todo filters
*** clockedtoday
   clockedtoday tests if the todo has a clock value and if either start or end spans today
   If you are using the clocking feature this makes it easier to get a quick list of things you have worked on today.
  
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "Todays Work":   ["Todos : clockedtoday"],
   #+END_SRC 

*** clockfilter
   clockfilter is like durationfilter in that it takes a duration specifier

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d"],
   #+END_SRC
