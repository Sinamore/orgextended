	- I found myself adding a Created property to a lot of new notes.
	  (I like timestamps on when a note has been created)
	  So I have added a new command Org Insert Created Property that will
	  auto insert a :Created: [TIMESTAMP] to a heading, saves me a few keystrokes.
	  (See above for the format)


** FIXED FILETAGS
   Filestags with colons around them were not having the colon stripped.
   This was a bug introduced a while back and I did not notice.
   This is no longer the case:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
      #+FILETAGS: :A:B:C:
   #+END_SRC 

   Will now correctly tag all nodes with A B and C tags

** FIXED Checkbox summaries
   Summaries that were followed by a list of checkboxes in a second heading could miscalculate the summary
   including checkboxes from the next heading

   #+BEGIN_SRC org

   * A [1/2]       <-- This would be miscalculated as [1/3] vs [1/2]
     - [ ] B
     - [x] C
   ** D 
     - [ ] E

   While still facilitating nested summaries:

   * Heading [3/5]
   - [x] A
   - [x] B
   - [ ] C
   - [-] D [1/3]
      - [ ] X
      - [x] Y
      - [ ] Z
   - [x] E

   #+END_SRC
   
** FIXED Clocking in and out was crashing
   Clocking in and out on a node was throwing exceptions due to the property
   drawer API attempting to operate on a root node missing some API. This should now be fixed.

** New Command Org Jump To Clock
   This will jump to an active clock if one is running. Currently not bound to anything.

** New Todo filters
*** clockedtoday
   clockedtoday tests if the todo has a clock value and if either start or end spans today
   If you are using the clocking feature this makes it easier to get a quick list of things you have worked on today.
  
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "Todays Work":   ["Todos : clockedtoday"],
   #+END_SRC 

*** clockfilter
   clockfilter is like durationfilter in that it takes a duration specifier

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d"],
   #+END_SRC

*** showduration
   This will show the amount of time in hours and minutes that you spent on a todo, in the todo view

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d : showduration"],
   #+END_SRC

*** hide filters
   3 Additional formatting options for task list views:

   - hidefilename
   - hideheading
   - hidestatus

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d : showduration : hidefilename"],
   #+END_SRC

   These will hide the filename, todo heading and todo status fields as desired in the listing.

*** showtotalduration
   This option will turn on a summary of the total duration at the end of task listing of tasks that were clocked.

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d : showduration : showtotalduration"],
   #+END_SRC

*** byproject
   This task pane option will group tasks by project adding a == [Project Name] == header to each project for clarity

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Todos : clockfilter +7d : showduration : showtotalduration : byproject"],
   #+END_SRC

** New Agenda Views
   Clocked view shows anything with a clock value including non todos

   For example this is different than the above as the above will show anything in an open state
   since it uses the Todo view while the following will actually show all work done on any node.
   Obviously this comes with a slight performance cost as it has to scan non todo nodes, but it makes
   the clocking feature more useful.

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "This Weeks Work":   ["Clocked : clockfilter +7d : showduration"],
   #+END_SRC

** Tweak to Composite Todo List Titles
   If the composite list only contains a single view, the name of the view is assigned the name of the composite view + [view name]
   This allows a custom view with "This Weeks Work" as the name to appear as:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     This Weeks Work [Clocked]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Increasing clarity as to the type of list you are viewing
