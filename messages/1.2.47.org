* 1.2.47
** FIXED Sometimes tasks were misidentified as being a task.
   - Tasks are defined as being a todo that has a parent and that parent is a project identifier.
   - NOTE: When I eventually support using the orgs server as an alternative to the orgdb the query language will
           be cleaner. Right now I am not a fan of how I chose to build these querries.
           
** New default state keywords added
   - FLAG - Personal state meaning this is waiting on processing. 
   - CLEANUP - Personal state meaning this todo is in the cleanup phase and needs further cleanup effort.
