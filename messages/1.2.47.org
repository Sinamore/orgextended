* 1.2.47
** FIXED Sometimes tasks were misidentified as being a task.
   - Tasks are defined as being a todo that has a parent and that parent is a project identifier.
   - NOTE: When I eventually support using the orgs server as an alternative to the orgdb the query language will
           be cleaner. Right now I am not a fan of how I chose to build these querries.
           
** New default state keywords added
	New open states:
    - FLAG - Personal state meaning this is waiting on processing. 
    - CLEANUP - Personal state meaning this todo is in the cleanup phase and needs further cleanup effort.

    New closed states:
    - FIXED - same as DONE
** FIXED Agenda color scheme was not highlighting filenames with underscores
