** FIXED Internal Target Highlighting
   - [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/62][Internal Target Problem]]

   Thanks to flintforge for reporting that adding an unterminated << to a line would cause the rest of the document to become
   an internal link in the org syntax setup as it is. This is now fixed:

   << Internal Link >>  - This should be a valid link
   << This is not a valid link


   | This | Table | Should | Be | Okay |
   |------+-------+--------+----+------|
   |    1 |     2 |      3 |  4 |    5 |
