* 1.2.37
  - Fixed a bug with agenda having extra spaces after calendar view.
** dayPage - Capture symbols
    - added {daypage} symbol as a capture target symbol
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "target": ["file","{daypage}"],
    #+END_SRC

    - you can now also set a symbol in your sublime settings file and use it as a target expansion:
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "mysym": "to use over and over"
        ...
        "target": ["file","{mysym}"],
    #+END_SRC

** Capture
   Added file+headline to capture templates.
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   "target": ["file+headline","{myfile}","MyHeadline"]
   #+END_SRC
