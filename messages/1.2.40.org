* 1.2.40
** Refile Improvements
	2 new commands for refiling:

	- org_refile_to_file command vs heading, quick refile at end of file.
	- org_refile_to_file_and_headline - 2 step prompt file + headline

	Right now bound to:
	- <space> r f for refile to file.
	- <space> r r for refile to file and headline

** Capture
	- Added new capture type: 'plain'
	  we now support 'entry' and 'plain' Eventually I will add all the capture types
	  but we are a bit off from that.
