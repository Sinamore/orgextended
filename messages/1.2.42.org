* 1.2.42
** Template formatter
	- Small enhancement to template formatting in settings file for capture templates.
	- Stolen from superformatter a very simple python template expansion tool.
	- {variable.<function>:call} will call a function on the variable contents (such as upper())
	- {variable:repeat:string to repeat for {{item}} } assuming variable is a list will output the string expanded per item in the list
	- {variable:if:string to output} Will output string to output if variable evaluates to true otherwise ""
** DatePicker
	- Fixed moving outside of the 3 month range. Highlighting today would fail and date would fail to update properly.
