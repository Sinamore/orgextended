* 1.2.42
** Template formatter
	- Small enhancement to template formatting in settings file for capture templates.
	- Stolen from superformatter a very simple python template expansion tool.
	- {variable.<function>:call} will call a function on the variable contents (such as upper())
	- {variable:repeat:string to repeat for {{item}} } assuming variable is a list will output the string expanded per item in the list
	- {variable:if:string to output} Will output string to output if variable evaluates to true otherwise ""
** DatePicker
	- Fixed moving outside of the 3 month range. Highlighting today would fail and date would fail to update properly.

** DayPage
   New option: "dayPageCopyTasksForToday": True
   This will copy all todos that would target today to the current daypage. This is experimental and will likely change in the future.
   Iterating with olBC to get this feature to his liking.
   The option can scan files in memory but not in your org dir if you turn on: "dayPageIncludeFilesOutsideOrgDir": true
