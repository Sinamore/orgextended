** Improved DatePicker
	- Working to improve the datepicker a bit, there is sooo much functionality that org offers here
	  and I only support a tiny fraction of the abilities.
	- Added clock to demonstrate current time to the datepicker.
	- Added Ctrl+Shift+. and Ctrl+Shift+, to change the active hour
	- Added Alt+Shift+. and Alt+Shift+, to change the active minute
	- Clock disappears if we failed to parse a time out of your date string.
