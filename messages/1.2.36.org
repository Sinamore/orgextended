* 1.2.36
** Improved DatePicker
	- Working to improve the datepicker a bit, there is sooo much functionality that org offers here
	  and I only support a tiny fraction of the abilities.
	- Added clock to demonstrate current time to the datepicker.
	- Added Ctrl+Shift+. and Ctrl+Shift+, to change the active hour
	- Added Alt+Shift+. and Alt+Shift+, to change the active minute
	- Clock disappears if we failed to parse a time out of your date string.
	- I have added REALLY basic duration capabilities to the date picker.

		#+BEGIN_SRC org
			1d    -- Will select a date tomorrow at the current time.
			3h    -- Will select a time 3h from now. 	  
		#+END_SRC	

	This is still nowhere NEAR: https://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html
	But I am slowly working in that direction. Hopefully one day we will have a date picker that
	that is as powerful and flexible as the full orgmode version.
