** Improving Org Capture
   - file+regexp now works for inserting entry's
   	 no item or anything else, just entry's but it works.
   	 This searches an org file line by line for the first match.
   	 ["file+regexp","filename","REGEX"]

   - file+olp - full path in a file. When there are multiple paths
     this is the safest.
     ["file+olp","filename","Heading level 1","Heading level 2" ...]
