* 1.2.32
** Agenda
   - Done - a new view that lists done tasks
	 WATCH OUT this can be massive! Use this with other filters.

** Insert Sibling Heading
   - If the next line has spaces the inserted heading could have spaces which is not a good idea.
     This is now stripped properly.

** Agenda
   - durationfilter added -2w filters items 2 weeks ago from right now. 
     a negative duration value will filter against CLOSED values while a positive will filter
     against SCHEDULED and DEADLINE values.
   - datefilter allows you to filter by absolute date range >=20210501 <=20210531
   - hasclose and other attributes were not handled properly as filter keywords, this has been fixed.

** Reveal Exporter
   - Tables are now actually supported

** Exporting
   - Tables had a bug if tabs were present in front of the table.

** Editing
   - New override setting: logDone - forces CLOSED entries to be inserted even if logdone
     is not in your #+STARTUP: tags or global "startup": "..." settings.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "logDone": true,
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Tables
   Found a bug with complete relative syntax.
   They were always evaluating to 1,1 in the table.

   This has been fixed.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     @-1$+1 
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Known issue:
   ------------
   Complex expansions are not working:

   @int($-1)$1
   This would look up the row from the neighboring cell

   There is a workaround for now till I can improve the parser

   getcell(int($-1), 1, 1, 0)
            |        |  |  not relative
            |        |  column 1
            |        relative offset
            grab value 1 cell to the left, ensure it is an int

*** New Table Commands
   
    The following will pull the active formula for the current cell into the current cell.
    Facilitating editing.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      Org Edit Table Formula
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    The following will clear the current cell

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      Org Clear Table Cell
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    The following will run a temporary formula on the cells on and below the cursor
    which can be handy when fixing up a table.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      Org Table Exec Below
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** Babel Preview
    - Improved results block discovery previously results might confuse a source block
      as being part of the results.
