** Agenda
   - Done - a new view that lists done tasks
	 WATCH OUT this can be massive! Use this with other fileters.

** Insert Sibling Heading
   - If the next line has spaces the inserted heading could have spaces which is not a good idea.
     This is now stripped properly.

** Agenda
   - durationfilter added -2w filters items 2 weeks ago from right now. 
   - datefilter allows you to filter by absolute date range >=20210501 <=20210531
   - hasclose and other attributes were not handled properly as filter keywords, this has been fixed.

** Reveal Exporter
   - Tables are now actually supported

** Exporting
   - Tables had a bug if tabs were present in front of the table.
