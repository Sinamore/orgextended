* 1.2.32
** Agenda
   - Done - a new view that lists done tasks
	 WATCH OUT this can be massive! Use this with other filters.

** Insert Sibling Heading
   - If the next line has spaces the inserted heading could have spaces which is not a good idea.
     This is now stripped properly.

** Agenda
   - durationfilter added -2w filters items 2 weeks ago from right now. 
     a negative duration value will filter against CLOSED values while a positive will filter
     against SCHEDULED and DEADLINE values.
   - datefilter allows you to filter by absolute date range >=20210501 <=20210531
   - hasclose and other attributes were not handled properly as filter keywords, this has been fixed.

** Reveal Exporter
   - Tables are now actually supported

** Exporting
   - Tables had a bug if tabs were present in front of the table.

** Editing
   - New override setting: logDone - forces CLOSED entries to be inserted even if logdone
     is not in your #+STARTUP: tags or global "startup": "..." settings.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "logDone": true,
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Tables
   Found a bug with complete relative syntax.
   They were always evaluating to 1,1 in the table.

   This has been fixed.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     @-1$+1 
   #+END_EXAMPLE
