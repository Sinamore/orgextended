** Backlinks Experimentation
	Org Roam is a very powerful package. I am nowhere near supporting the power pretty views and flexibility of that package.
	That said, I am experimenting with the backlinks feature. This release has an experimental version of the org-roam backlinks
	view. These are links that are referencing your current document in your orgDirs not links that this document references. 


	- Org Jump To Backlinks - is a new quick menu command that shows the links referencing your current file and lets you jump to them.
	- Org Show Backlinks - is a new command that pops up a panel with the backlinks to the file you are currently looking at.

	This is an experimental feature. It automatically tries to keep the backlinks display visible but this is somewhat challenging with the existing
	sublime API. You can turn this off if it is causing you problems:

	Turn off the attempts to update the backlinks display using the following option in your settings file:
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	 "backlinksUpdate": false, 
	#+END_EXAMPLE

** Mermaid Source Blocks

	- Syntax is supported if you install the mermaid package
	- Can be executed to generate diagrams if setup.

	Setting it up is a bit of a pain:

	1. npm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
	2. NOTE it gets installed into a node_modules folder. This is REQUIRED!
	3. Set the mermaid variable in your settings to point to mmdc in the node_modules\.bin\mmdc path
	4. Ensure node is in your path 

	Then execute this block:

	#+BEGIN_SRC mermaid :file ganttdemo.png
