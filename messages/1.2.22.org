** Table Bug
	Fixing a remote indexing bug.
	If the local table does not have enough columns to match your remote index
	the remote target would get capped to the local width:

	Note the a in the second table, it should have been a b, this is because we are
	trying to access column 2 remotely but our local table only has 1 column.

	The temporary fix was to add another column.

    #+NAME: hiya
    | a | b | c |
    | 1 | 2 |   |

    | a |
    #+TBLFM:@1$1=remote('hiya',@1$2)

    After the fix this now reads b

** Link Insertion
	- Thanks to waynezhang link insertion using "Link To File" or the autocomplete
	  method now inserts relative paths relative to the current file.
	- The title of the link reflects the #+TITLE: field in the file is present.
	- "linkFindUseRoamTags": False will turn off visualization of ROAM_TAGS in quick panel
	  if desired. (NOTE they do not appear in the search unless you have them in the file)
