** Table Bug
	Fixing a remote indexing bug.
	If the local table does not have enough columns to match your remote index
	the remote target would get capped to the local width:

	Note the a in the second table, it should have been a b, this is because we are
	trying to access column 2 remotely but our local table only has 1 column.

	The temporary fix was to add another column.

    #+NAME: hiya
    | a | b | c |
    | 1 | 2 |   |

    | a |
    #+TBLFM:@1$1=remote('hiya',@1$2)

    After the fix this now reads b

** Link Insertion
	- Thanks to waynezhang link insertion using "Link To File" or the autocomplete
	  method now inserts relative paths relative to the current file.
	- The title of the link reflects the #+TITLE: field in the file is present.
	- "linkFindUseRoamTags": False will turn off visualization of ROAM_TAGS in quick panel
	  if desired. (NOTE they do not appear in the search unless you have them in the file)

** Capture
	- Somehow the snippets folder was not renamed orgsnippets when I normalized
	  my extension folder names. This means that while my local snippets were working
	  none of the default ones that come with the package were working.
	  Hopefully this has been fixed.

** Day Page
	- I am moving the day page feature forward a little bit.
	- Do not forget to set the "dayPagePath" setting if using this feature
	- "Org Day Page Create" is really going to be more of a
	  goto today. It will create the day page or open it.
	- Create also now uses a snippet that is keyed off of:
	  This should be the filename of a snippet file that lives in your
	  orgsnippets folder. (without the .sublime-snippet extension)

 	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 	    "dayPageSnippet": "dayPageSnippet",
 	  #+END_EXAMPLE 

 	  This snippet will get expanded into the file on creation as a means
 	  of authoring a new day. Symbols exist to help in your snippet authoring 
 	  the list of symbols is similar to the capture templates.

 	  Two new symbols exist for use in your snippet:
 	  ORG_FILENAME is the filename without the org extension and
 	  ORG_AUTHOR is your username.

    - Day Page Filenames are now configurable
      They use the python strftime syntax for defining the filename:

      Note changing this with pre-existing content will likely have consequences
      when searching old files.

    	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    	  "dayPageNameFormat": "%a_%Y_%m_%d",
    	#+END_EXAMPLE

    - New Commands:
    	Lets you cycle through your day pages in sequence.

    	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    	  Org Day Page Next
    	  Org Day Page Previous
    	#+END_EXAMPLE
