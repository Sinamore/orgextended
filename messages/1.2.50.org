* 1.2.50
** Agenda
*** FIXED Task Lists
	- Some print cleanup from the sublime output window.

** Tables
   - Fixed some tabbing problems (mostly highlight related in some generated tables)
   - Problem was both a potential exception AND a table living at global scope
     the keybinding was going to the global scope tab binding rather than the
     table keybinding which was causing improper behaviour.
