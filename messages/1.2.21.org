* 1.2.21
** Html Exporter
	- Exporting source blocks that do not have handlers was generating an error.

** Early Preview of Latex Exporter
	- An early perview of a new latex exporter.
	- Many of the basic org data types work already.
	- Thanks to FleurDePassion for his time in helping work on this.

** Links To Files in OrgDirs

	New command: quick panel based insertion of links to files

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	"Org Link To File" 
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	This was requested by: [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/30][Autocompletion of Links]] 

	In addition to the quick insert autocompletion during link insertion also tries to help with mapping to local files if possible. You can turn off autocomplete
	in the settings file if you are finding it annoying.

** Home Directory orgDirs
	Thanks to waynezhang for implementing this.
	We now support ~ in orgDirs in your settings file.
