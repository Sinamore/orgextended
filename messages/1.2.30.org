* 1.2.30
** Auto Indentation
   - Not yet perfect but some simple auto indentation rules
   - begin blocks are automatically indended.
   - Headings get indentation inserted when you hit enter off them

** BEGIN_NOTES
   - notes block added to syntax highlighter
   - <n snippet added as well.

** Known Issues
   - Since the default reveal.js exporter uses a CDN the presenter
     notes are not being shown because the notes.html file is not hosted
     anymore. I will work to fix this in the future.

     (As well as upgrade to the latest reveal.js distribution)
