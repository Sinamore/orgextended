** Editing
   - Tag insertion could not insert tags on headings with colons
     this has now been fixed.
     [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/38][Issue]] 

** Syntax Highlighting
   - Internal syntaxes are now hidden.
   - Syntaxes are now marked as version 2 which may improve perf.

** Org Beancount Experiment
   This is a bit of a departure from org's primary purpose.
   I however use beancount and beancount is designed to work
   inside other markup languages like markdown and... orgmode!

   Due to how packages and syntaxes work I have not found a good
   way to create an amalgamated syntax without doing inside the
   orgmode package. So... here we are. By default we highlight
   .orgbeancount files.

   This also adds a snippet for inserting a transaction with
   some additional metadata. My hope is to eventually facilitate
   babel and beancount.
