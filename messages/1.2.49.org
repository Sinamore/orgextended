** FIXED Clocking out
	- When clocking in to a different file while a previous clock was running the clock value was getting written
	  to the wrong file due to using the wrong view!
	- We now open the other file, add the clock out value, save it and switch back to the correct buffer
** REMINDER org_agenda_custom_view
   Recently I was asked about todo views. I thought I would take a moment and
   highlight what is already there. 

	The org_agenda_choose_custom_view command can be handy
	for scanning through your todo lists, but if you are like me,
	it can get in the way.

	You can bind your own keybindings and select a particular view quickly like so:
	Here I am using a neovintageous style keybinding to pop up my "This Weeks Work" list
	when I press <space> o l w in normal mode. (Think VIM) You can do much the same for whatever your
	preferences might be.


	#+BEGIN_SRC js
    { "keys": [" ","o", "l", "w"]
    , "command": "org_agenda_custom_view"
    , "args": {"toShow": "This Weeks Work"}
    , "context": [{"key": "vi_command_mode_aware"}]  
    },
	#+END_SRC

	This view is created using the view syntax like so:

	#+BEGIN_SRC js
    "AgendaCustomViews": 
    {
    	# My agenda is comprised of several standard views
        "Default":           ["Calendar", "Week", "Day", "Blocked Projects", "Loose Tasks"],
        # Show any todos tagged as being active
        "Active":            ["Todos : tagfilter +Active"],
        # Show my todos tagged as being part of my backlog.
        "Backlog":           ["Todos : tagfilter +Backlog"],
        # Show anything, not just todos that have been clocked within the last 7 days. Also show their duration
        # and group them in projects if they are associated with a project.
        "This Weeks Work":   ["Clocked : clockfilter +7d : showduration : showtotalduration : byproject"],
    },
	#+END_SRC

	
** Agenda Task Lists
	- Todo lists now have a dynamic filter option. This option will provide an input box that allows you to dynamically filter the text in the todo list.
	- The keybinding is REALLY rough right now. 
		- In neovintageous mode "f","f" will bring back up the input box allowing for more filtering goodness.
		- In normal mode alt+o f f will bring back up the input box allowing for more filtering goodness.
	- Escape will clear the filter
	- Enter will make the filter permanent allowing you to scroll through todos again.

	You can force this input panel to have focus and be visible when the todo list pops up with the following option:

	If sublime will ever support more rich panels I would love to add dynamic filtering by tag, priority and other things in there.
	For now I will have to add then piecemeal.

	#+BEGIN_SRC js
    "agendaTodoFilterByDefault": true,
	#+END_SRC

*** New todo view columns
    - showdate - will show most relevant date information (active, scheduled, dealine, closed timestamp)
    - showtime - will show the time info from the most relevant date information

    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "This Weeks Work":   ["Clocked : clockfilter +7d : showduration : showtotalduration : byproject : showdate : showtime"],
    #+END_SRC

*** Better todo sorting
    - Now sorts by date by default, will be looking to make this configurable going forward as well.
