** FIXED Clocking out
	- When clocking in to a different file while a previous clock was running the clock value was getting written
	  to the wrong file due to using the wrong view!
	- We now open the other file, add the clock out value, save it and switch back to the correct buffer

** Todo Lists
	- Todo lists now have a dynamic filter option. This option will provide an input box that allows you to dynamically filter the text in the todo list.
	- The keybinding is REALLY rough right now. In neovintageous mode "f","f" will bring back up the input box allowing for more filtering goodness.
	- Escape will clear the filter
	- Enter will make the filter permanent allowing you to scroll through todos again.
