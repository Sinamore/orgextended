** Capture Supports Unicode
	- [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/57][Fix for Capture fails silently with unicode error]] 

	Captures that contained unicode characters would fail. This was
	due to the fact that the capture mechanism was not saving files with the default text encoding.

	There is a new option that allows you to control the format of the destination capture file:
	#+BEGIN_SRC js
    // What file format should we write out as. This should be a python encoding value
    // CAN BE:
    // - utf-8
    // - utf-16
    // - utf-32
    // SEE: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
    "captureWriteFormat": "utf-8",
	#+END_SRC

	The default is now utf-8


** Rounding Out Tag Support
   Added new option to control the tag column when inserting tags:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
    // Where should tags start in a headline?
    // Tags will get inserted at this column
    "tagColumn" : 80,
   #+END_SRC

   3 new commands (sadly t is used for timestamp so I am using m for mark...)
   - Org Remove Tag      ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> r m)     Prompt to remove a tag
   - Org Remove All Tags ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> r a m)   Removes all tags from current headline
   - Org Fix Tags        ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> f m)     Will re-indent all tags in the file to the tag column specified



** Autocalculated Rows Fix
	- [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/59][in tables, auto calculating rows sometimes break a column formula]]

	Thanks to JosefTaylor reporting that autocalculating tables sometimes get confused with table formulas.
	Some improvements have been made to fix this going forward.

	The problem was that as you edit the column you can cross over into the next cell's space while editing. 
	This was confusing the automatic targetting for the formula since the destination cell
	was computed before the table was reformatted. I have added a table align before recomputing the cell.
	It's a little slower when tabbing around but should result in correct behaviour.
