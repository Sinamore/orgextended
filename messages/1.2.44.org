** Capture Supports Unicode
	- [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/57][Fix for Capture fails silently with unicode error]] 

	Captures that contained unicode characters would fail. This was
	due to the fact that the capture mechanism was not saving files with the default text encoding.

	There is a new option that allows you to control the format of the destination capture file:
	#+BEGIN_SRC js
    // What file format should we write out as. This should be a python encoding value
    // CAN BE:
    // - utf-8
    // - utf-16
    // - utf-32
    // SEE: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
    "captureWriteFormat": "utf-8",
	#+END_SRC

	The default is now utf-


** Rounding Out Tag Support
   Added new option to control the tag column when inserting tags:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
    // Where should tags start in a headline?
    // Tags will get inserted at this column
    "tagColumn" : 80,
   #+END_SRC

   3 new commands (sadly t is used for timestamp so I am using m for mark...)
   - Org Remove Tag      ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> r m)     Prompt to remove a tag
   - Org Remove All Tags ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> r a m)   Removes all tags from current headline
   - Org Fix Tags        ::   (NeoVintageous: <space> f m)     Will re-indent all tags in the file to the tag column specified
