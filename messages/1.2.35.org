** Bold Italic etc only on word boundaries
   - Emacs only supports these types on word boundaries:
      _THIS_SHOULD_NOT_BE_HIGHLIGHTED_
      _THISSHOULDBE_

      /This/Is/Not/Italics/
      /This is italics/
*** SubHeading

** Initial Trello Support
   - Ability to author an org file from a trello board. This requires that you have installed the Trello package and set it up.
     Running "Org Trello Sync Board" Will let you select a board and generate an org file from it.
   - Eventually I would like this to be a 2 way sync but that is going to take a bit more work.
